    "Transport phenomena is the study of the transferring of momentum, energy and mass. Oftentimes these processes are coupled as in boiling water, where bubbles of air trapped in the water nucleate due to the elevated temperature reducing the solubility of gases, followed by the density differences between the bubble and water causing the bubble to rise. These processes are further mediated through convection currents caused by temperature gradients in the boiling water. \n",

    "2 main ways to perform compute on multiple cores are available. They are openMP and MPI based techniques. These differ on how memory is allocated between processors, which also impacts the scalability and performance of each based on system size and allocated resources. openMP uses shared memory to remove the need for message passing but is only supported by systems that share memory. MPI supports parallel computation for systems with distributed or shared memory as each process is executes independently from one another.\n",

    "In the TS plot, despite this phase containing no explicit communication, the distributions reveal a consistent that non-blocking implementations achieve both lower average times and smaller variances, indicating better computational efficiency and more consistent performance. The blocking variants, in contrast, show wider distributions suggesting higher variability, likely due to delayed transitions from prior communication phases and less efficient CPU scheduling. The addition of multi-threading using openMP improves performance in the non-blocking communication strategy but paradoxically seems to reduce performance when using a blocking strategy. This shows that asynchronous communication which facilitates simultaneous compute and communication between cores reduces communication costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar trends can be seen in the halo exchange (MP) and total rutime (total) plots. The non-blocking hybrid configuration shows the shortest and least varying compute time. In contrast, the blocking non-hybrid approach is both the slowest and most unstable, suffering from high execution time variability and inefficiencies in both communication and computation.\n",
