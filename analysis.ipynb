    "Transport phenomena is the study of the transferring of momentum, energy and mass. Oftentimes these processes are coupled as in boiling water, where bubbles of air trapped in the water nucleate due to the elevated temperature reducing the solubility of gases, followed by the density differences between the bubble and water causing the bubble to rise. These processes are further mediated through convection currents caused by temperature gradients in the boiling water. \n",

We will assume periodic boundary conditions to overcome the limitation of finite sizes in compute and assume that the temperature in the source reduces at the same time.  (INSERT IMAGE HERE)"
